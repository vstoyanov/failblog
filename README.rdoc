== FAILblog
This is a very simplistic blog/personal website engine, written in ruby. It's initial goal is to end up serving as CMS
for http://vstoyanov.eu, the personal webpage of its author.
Its second major (and primary) goal is self-study and experimentation, so I will try to keep the code-base as cutting
edge as possible, even at the price of some overkills. On other hand I will try to keep it simple both architecturally
and codewise
